# Dfenestration

A general cross-platform desktop GUI toolkit in D, inspired of the GTK+ 2 philosophy.

"Why this old philosophy instead of something more modern?" you might say.

Because there are already a lot of modern toolkits in trendy programming languages.

Whereas traditional frameworks are becoming rarer, and harder to use with the time.

My answer is to make a framework with a somewhat old architecture. Surely not optimal 
but good enough and easy to use.


## Example code

```d
import dfenestration.widgets.aligner;
import dfenestration.widgets.buttonbase;
import dfenestration.widgets.column;
import dfenestration.widgets.test;
import dfenestration.widgets.text;
import dfenestration.widgets.window;
import dfenestration.primitives;

int main()
    => new Window()
        .title("Dfenestration example")
    [
        new Aligner()
        [
            new Column()
                .spacing(8)
            [
                new Test()
                    .size(Size(200, 200))
                    .naturalSize(Size(300, 300)),

                new Button()
                    .pressed((_) => info("Click registered!"))
                [
                    new Text(text: "Hello!!")
                ]
            ]
        ],
    ].run();
```

## Goals

_and explaining my design choices_

An all-purpose GUI framework written in D. Like GTK or Qt. \
But not an application framework, so it won't manage multiple instances and an app
and wrap cross-process communication.

Still, I want it to be suitable to make a full desktop environment!

To be more precise, I distinguish the GUI part from the app part.

The GUI is making buttons, sliders, on a window. At the edge of that feature set you 
have multimedia use (that will be implemented in order to have a video widget), and
some system-specific stuff such as file picking dialogs. Those would probably be more
suited for a separate library, that could be re-used across different GUI toolkits (I 
may make that library too).

Application stuff like IPC, app instance management, command line handling is ignored
here, and hopefully someone else will tackle that in another library (again, if no one
wants to make a separate library, I may do that).

Some choices have been made in that sense:
- Using as much library written in D as possible.
- ...although text is rendered with FreeType and Harfbuzz, and Fribidi is used. I am not
an expert in every language of this world, so using the standard is better here. 
- Accessibility should work correctly at the end. This may imply using access-kit
to ensure a correct support for every platform.

I want to do that. I think that would be better. But for now everything is integrated
because splitting everything from the start is unpractical for development.

## WIP

- Font shaping
- Pop-up support/multiple windows. xdg-toplevel-drag.
- click, touch, scroll, gestures!
- focus management (nextFocus, previousFocus), accels

## Known issues

- XCB is hard linked, so you'll need it.
- XCB backend is flickering
- XCB + Nvidia is buggy.
- Vulkan + Wayland + Nvidia is buggy.

## Current support

- Wayland
  - System cursor themes
  - Wayland cursor protocol
  - Integer scaling
  - Fractional scaling
  - Decorations (Wayland + KDE specific)
  - EGL/OpenGL
  - Vulkan (through VkVG)
- X11 (through XCB, not Xlib!)
  - OpenGL (through EGL-XCB, not GLX! requires recent GPU drivers!)
  - Vulkan (through VkVG)

## Roadmap

- Platform support

  |                            | Software | OpenGL    | Vulkan | Metal |
  |----------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
  | Wayland (xdg-shell + DLCs) |          | OK (EGL)  | wip    | -     |
  | X11 (xcb)                  |          | wip (EGL) | wip    | -     |
  | Windows                    |          |           |        | -     |
  | macOS                      |          | maybe     | maybe  |       |

For now, support for other platforms is not planned. I used xdg-shell for Wayland as
it is now the standard. Don't be surprised if some of the things GTK+ 3 is doing are
different in dfenestration (GTK+ 3 used wl-shell-surface).

- Accessibility
  - [ ] Access-kit
  - [ ] AT-SPI (Linux)
  - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] macOS

Wayland is the first to be supported since it's the most barebones one. By taking care of
it first the toolkit won't make any assumption about any feature support in the
implementation.

Priority:

- [x] Platform support: Wayland support (Software and OpenGL) with xdg-decorations support
- [ ] Button and text (with rtl built-in) widgets
- [ ] Styling?
- [ ] _almost_ Platform support: X11 support (with any renderer)
- [ ] Making a TextLine widget
- [ ] Making a ScrollView widget
- [ ] Accessibility: AT-SPI
- [ ] Fractional scaling on Wayland
- [ ] Platform support: Windows (with any renderer)
- [ ] Accessibility: Windows
- [ ] Theming (theme engines, affecting defaults and draws)
- [ ] Example: Port a complex widget from GTK+ 2
- [ ] **Stabilise API**
- [ ] Platform support: macOS (Software)
- [ ] Accessibility: macOS
- [ ] Blur effects on Windows, macOS and KDE
